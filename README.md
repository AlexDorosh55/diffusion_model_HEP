# diffusion_model_HEP
This repository contain scripts for DM for modeling distributions in calorimeter LHC. Here are 3 files:
1. `GAN library.zip` contain functions from previous works off my supervisor - Ratnikov F.D. - which was used for visualization dictributions in calorimeter and calculate PRD scores (physical and energy)
2. `Final model's configuration.ipunb` contain configuration and learning proccess for our Diffusion model.
3. `Calculating metrics.ipunb` contain calculating PRD scores for generated distributions of DM model
